# DeepL Translation API Configuration Template
# Add this to your main config.yml file

deepl:
  # DeepL API Key (required)
  # Get your API key from: https://www.deepl.com/pro-api
  # Can also be set via DEEPL_API_KEY environment variable (takes priority)
  api_key: "YOUR_DEEPL_API_KEY"

  # DeepL API Server URL (optional)
  # Free API: https://api-free.deepl.com (default)
  # Pro API:  https://api.deepl.com
  server_url: "https://api-free.deepl.com"

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit real API keys to version control
# - Use environment variables for production: export DEEPL_API_KEY="your-key"
# - Free API has usage limits, upgrade to Pro for higher limits
# - Rotate API keys regularly

# Example configurations:
#
# Free API (default):
# deepl:
#   api_key: "your-free-api-key:fx"
#   server_url: "https://api-free.deepl.com"
#
# Pro API:
# deepl:
#   api_key: "your-pro-api-key"
#   server_url: "https://api.deepl.com"
#
# Using environment variable (recommended for production):
# export DEEPL_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# # No need to set api_key in config file
