# AWS SES Configuration Template
# Add this to your main config.yml file

aws:
  ses:
    # AWS Credentials
    access_key: "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
    secret_key: "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"

    # Use EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) for credentials
    # Set to true when running on EC2 with IAM role
    # Set to false to use static credentials (access_key/secret_key)
    use_imds: false

    # SES Region
    # us-east-1 is recommended as it's the primary SES region
    region: "us-east-1"

    # Default sender email address (must be verified in SES)
    # This is optional but recommended for simpler API usage
    default_from: "noreply@yourdomain.com"

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit real credentials to version control
# - Use environment variables for production:
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - Use IAM roles when running on EC2 (set use_imds: true, no credentials needed!)
# - Rotate credentials regularly

# SES Setup Notes:
# Before using SES, you must:
# 1. Verify your sender email address or domain in AWS SES console
# 2. If in sandbox mode, also verify recipient email addresses
# 3. Request production access to send to any email address
# 4. SES is commonly available in us-east-1, us-west-2, and eu-west-1
