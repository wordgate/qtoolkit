# SES Configuration Example
# Copy this file and replace with your actual values

# AWS Credentials (optional if using EC2 IAM role)
access_key: "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
secret_key: "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"

# Use EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) for credentials
# Set to true when running on EC2 with IAM role
# Set to false to use static credentials (access_key/secret_key)
use_imds: true

# SES Region
# us-east-1 is recommended as it's the primary SES region
region: "us-east-1"

# Default sender email address (must be verified in SES)
# This is optional but recommended for simpler API usage
# When set, you can use SendMail() without specifying the sender
default_from: "noreply@yourdomain.com"

# Note: Before using SES, you must:
# 1. Verify your sender email address or domain in AWS SES console
# 2. If in sandbox mode, also verify recipient email addresses
# 3. Request production access to send to any email address
