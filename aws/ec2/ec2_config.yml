# AWS EC2 Configuration Template
# Add this to your main config.yml file

aws:
  ec2:
    # AWS Credentials
    access_key: "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
    secret_key: "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"

    # Use EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) for credentials
    # Set to true when running on EC2 with IAM role
    # Set to false to use static credentials (access_key/secret_key)
    use_imds: false

    # EC2 Region
    region: "us-east-1"

# Security Notes:
# - Never commit real credentials to version control
# - Use environment variables for production:
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - Use IAM roles when running on EC2 (set use_imds: true, no credentials needed!)
# - Rotate credentials regularly
# - Use least-privilege IAM policies

# EC2 Usage Notes:
# - Make sure to configure VPC and security groups appropriately
# - Consider using launch templates for consistent instance configuration
# - Always tag instances for better organization and cost tracking
