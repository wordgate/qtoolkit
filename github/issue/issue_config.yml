# GitHub Issues Integration Configuration Template
# Add this to your main config.yml file

github:
  # Repository owner (username or organization)
  owner: "YOUR_GITHUB_OWNER"

  # Repository name
  repo: "YOUR_GITHUB_REPO"

  # GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
  # Create at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  # Required scopes: repo (for private repos) or public_repo (for public repos)
  # IMPORTANT: Use environment variable in production!
  token: "${GITHUB_TOKEN}"

  # Label name that marks official replies
  # Issues with this label will have HasOfficial=true
  # Default: "official-reply"
  official_label: "official-reply"

  # GitHub usernames that should be marked as official commenters
  # Comments from these users will have IsOfficial=true
  official_users:
    - "your-support-bot"
    - "your-team-member"

  # Cache TTL in seconds for issue list and details
  # Default: 300 (5 minutes)
  # Higher values reduce GitHub API calls but increase staleness
  cache_ttl: 300

# Security Notes:
# - NEVER commit real token to version control
# - Use environment variable: export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
# - Token needs 'repo' scope for private repos, 'public_repo' for public repos
# - Consider using GitHub App for better rate limits in production
